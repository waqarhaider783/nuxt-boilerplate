    <h3>
      There are plenty of internships for gap year students that will give you a
      head start before uni.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Interning abroad can combine useful, career-furthering experience with a
      great holiday opportunity. Although an unpaid internship might seem like a
      rough deal in the short term, gaining experience in your area of study is
      one of the best things you can do to boost your job prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not sure where to go? Consider which countries will provide the most
      relevant placement for your degree. If you’re looking to study journalism,
      a native English speaking country is a must - the US and Canada are great
      picks for media internships that will look great on your CV. (Bonus points
      if you choose a publication that has international offices)! If you’re
      going into an art or design degree, consider a cultural hub like Japan or
      Italy where you could get experience working in a gallery or arts centre.
      Chances are, you’re interested in the area you’re planning to study, so
      heading somewhere relevant won’t be all work and no play!
